# 3D Visualization for Spatial Audio Environment

## Overview
This project creates an immersive 3D visualization system for spatial audio, allowing users to experience and interact with audio sources positioned in a virtual 3D environment. The system renders six speakers in a hexagonal arrangement around a central listener, with real-time audio routing between speakers based on predefined patterns.

## Key Components

### 3D Visualization (`3DVisualization.js`)
- Creates an immersive 3D scene with speakers, environment, and listener avatar
- Provides joystick and drag controls for rotation within the audio space
- Visualizes sound waves emanating from active speakers
- Renders a 2D top-down view with speaker activity indicators

### Audio Processing (`script.js`)
- Implements spatial audio using the Web Audio API
- Routes audio between six virtual speakers based on predefined patterns
- Synchronizes audio playback with visual elements
- Supports play/pause and reset functionality

### Audio Visualization (`AudioVisualizer.js`)
- Shows speaker activity and music phrases
- Provides timeline visualization with phrase markers
- Includes waveform visualization of the audio

## User Interaction
- Rotate the listener using joystick or drag controls
- Play/pause audio with controls
- Reset position and audio with reset button
- View active speakers in both 3D and 2D perspectives

## Technical Details
- Built with Three.js for 3D rendering
- Uses Web Audio API for spatial audio processing
- Implements HRTF panning for realistic spatial audio perception
- Responsive design with adaptations for mobile devices

## Browser Compatibility
- Optimized for Chrome and other modern browsers supporting Web Audio API
- Requires browser support for ES6 modules and three.js
